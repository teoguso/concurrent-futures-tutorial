Concurrent.futures 101
================================
Built-in concurrency made easy
----------------------------------

Python usually gets a bad rep because "it's slow".  
While this is generally true, there is nowadays a plethora
of tools and techniques that help with improving
python's speed.

`concurrent.futures` is a module of the standard
library that provides a high-level API for running
asynchronous code using threads or processes.

I'll show how the module can be used to accelerate
python code in a fairly
straightforward way. 

I'll show how threads and processes can be used in
different scenarios such as data processing or
web applications.
I'll explore the caveats and the trade-offs
of using asynchronous python code.

Finally, I'll explore other available
alternatives for making python faster with their
pros and cons.
